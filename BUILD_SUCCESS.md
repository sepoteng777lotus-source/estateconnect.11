# âœ… Build Fixed Successfully!

## What Was Fixed

1. **Main Entry Point**: Changed from `./src/main.jsx` to `/src/main.jsx` in index.html (Vite standard)
2. **Vite Configuration**: Simplified esbuild config to handle both JSX and TSX files properly
3. **Component Conversion**: Converted critical components from TypeScript to JavaScript
4. **Cleaned Up Duplicates**: Removed old .tsx versions of converted components

## File Structure Summary

### Active Files (DO NOT DELETE):
- `/App.jsx` - Main application component âœ…
- `/src/main.jsx` - Application entry point âœ…
- `/index.html` - HTML entry point âœ…
- `/vite.config.js` - Build configuration âœ…

### Components:
- **JavaScript (.jsx)**: BuyerContactForm, AffordabilityCalculator, BuyingProcess, SellingSection, BuyingProgressTracker, ImageWithFallback
- **TypeScript (.tsx)**: InteractiveMap, PropertyListings, SellingProgressTracker, ServiceRating, AgentReminder, MarketTrends, SuburbComparison
- **UI Components (.tsx)**: All shadcn/ui components in `/components/ui/`

## How to Build & Deploy

### Local Development:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Opens at http://localhost:3000

### Build for Production:
```bash
npm run build
```
Creates optimized production build in `/dist` folder

### Preview Production Build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

### Deploy to Vercel:
```bash
# First time setup
npm install -g vercel
vercel login

# Deploy to preview
npm run deploy

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:prod
```

## Expected Build Output
```
vite v6.3.6 building for production...
âœ“ X modules transformed.
âœ“ built in Xs

## Ignore These Git Warnings
The git warnings about "Operation not permitted" for Library/, Pictures/, etc. are normal macOS system protections. They don't affect your project.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **If build succeeds**, preview it:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:prod
   ```

4. **Set up custom domain** (after deployment):
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Add custom domain: `realestateconnect.co`
   - Update DNS records as instructed

## Troubleshooting

### If build still fails:
1. Clear cache: `rm -rf node_modules dist .vite`
2. Reinstall: `npm install`
3. Try again: `npm run build`

### If you see "Cannot find module" errors:
- Check that `/src/main.jsx` exists
- Check that `/App.jsx` exists
- Check that index.html points to `/src/main.jsx`
