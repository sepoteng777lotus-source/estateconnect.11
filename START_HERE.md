# 🚀 START HERE - Deploy Your Real Estate Website

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes to Live Website)

Your website is **100% ready** for Vercel deployment. Follow these 3 simple steps:

---

## Step 1: Push to GitHub (2 minutes)

Open your terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Real Estate Benoni Boksburg - Ready for deployment"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace:**
- `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username
- `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your repository name (e.g., `real-estate-benoni-boksburg`)

**Don't have a GitHub repository?**
1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Create a new repository
3. Copy the repository URL
4. Use it in the commands above
