# âœ… Build Error Fixed

## What Was Wrong

The `App.tsx` file had Google Tag Manager HTML code accidentally inserted at the top of the file, which caused a syntax error because React/TypeScript files cannot contain raw HTML comments or script tags.

## What Was Fixed

Removed ALL Google Tag Manager HTML code from the top of `App.tsx`:

```html
<!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
<noscript><iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-TPXSS3DF"
height="0" width="0" style="display:none;visibility:hidden"></iframe></noscript>
<!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
```

**The file now starts correctly with:**
```typescript
import { BuyerContactForm } from './components/BuyerContactForm';
```

**Note:** If you want to add Google Tag Manager in the future, add it to `/index.html` instead:
- Add the `<script>` part in the `<head>` section
- Add the `<noscript>` part right after the opening `<body>` tag
